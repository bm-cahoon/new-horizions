                <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    At New Horizons Tech Recovery, we believe in the transformative power of technology
                    and education. Our vision is to empower individuals in recovery from substance abuse by
                    providing them with the tools, skills, and certifications needed to forge a new path in the
                    technology sector. We recognize that recovery is not just about overcoming a challenge; it's about
                    building a new life. Our mission extends beyond the confines of traditional rehabilitation by
                    investing in the future of those in treatment centers, offering a path to employment and a new life path.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are looking to partner with recovery homes and 3/4 houses to offer accredited IT courses. 
                    Our goal is to offer hope and a concrete pathway to a fulfilling career, enabling our participants to not 
                    only reintegrate into society but to thrive as valued members of the tech community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    New Horizons Tech Recovery stands as a beacon of opportunity, illuminating a path to
                    dignity, purpose, and economic independence. We are committed to changing lives, one
                    certification at a time, by ensuring that our participants have access to quality education and the
                    support they need to succeed. By investing in people at their most vulnerable, we create a ripple
                    effect of positivity that extends far beyond the individual, fostering a culture of growth,
                    resilience, and continuous improvement.
