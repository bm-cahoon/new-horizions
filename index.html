  <h2>About</h2>
  <div class="about-paragraph">
    <p>New Horizons Tech Recovery is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing opportunity, training, and support to individuals in recovery who are pursuing a career in technology. We are currently in the process of obtaining 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, which will allow us to further our mission with greater transparency, eligibility for grants, and the ability to offer tax-deductible donations. Our goal is to create a sustainable and impactful organization that reinvests directly into the lives and futures of those we serve.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="how-it-works" class="content-section content-box">
  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 1: Find Your Certification</h3>
    <p>Choose any technical certification and training course that aligns with your career goals. This could include certifications such as CompTIA Security+, A+, Network+, or other relevant IT certifications designed to help you successfully transition into the technology sector.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 2: Submit Your Application</h3>
    <p>Visit the tab on the sidebar labeled Applicaiton and fill out the submission form. Share your personal story, detailing your journey in recovery and your passion for entering the Information Technology field. Include specifics about the certification or training program you wish to undertake.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 3: Review and Assistance</h3>
    <p>Upon receiving your submission, the New Horizons Tech Recovery team will review your application. Our goal is to support your request by funding the selected training course and certification exam on your behalf. If for any reason the chosen course and or exam lacks a voucher or external procurement option, we may recommend an alternative option.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 4: Funding and Support</h3>
    <p>All training courses and certification tests are directly funded by New Horizons Tech Recovery through donations. We do not provide any direct financial assistance to individuals. Instead, funds go towards the costs of the certification courses and exams.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="step">
    <h3>Step 5: Donation-Driven</h3>
    <p>New Horizons Tech Recovery is entirely supported by donations from individuals and organizations. We are not a rehabilitation center, but an organization focused on providing critical skills and training to those in recovery, empowering them to rebuild their lives by entering the Information Technology field.</p>
